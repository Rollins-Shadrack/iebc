<p class="container"> <span class=""><i class="bi bi-quote"></i></span> Transparent, Free, fair, and credible elections are core to electoral democracy and provide vital 
means of empowering citizens to hold their leaders accountable. However, accountability of 
public officials in Kenya has been undermined by the fact that elections in the country are 
perennially fraught with irregularities. The announcement of the disputed 2007 presidential 
election results in Kenya on December 27th, 2007 led to what could be described as the worst 
political crisis in Kenyan post-colonial history. This study was guided by the following specific 
objectives; to establish the effect of Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) on the credibility of the 
Electoral System in Nairobi County, to determine the effect of Electronic Voter Identification 
System (EVID) on the credibility of the Electoral System in Nairobi County. The study was 
anchored on Technology Acceptance Theory and employed a descriptive research design. The 
target population was 2,251,929 registered voters in Nairobi County and 40 Independent 
Electoral and Boundaries Commission, technical officials. A sample size of 351 respondentswas 
used determined using Fisher’s (2007) formula. Primary data for this study was collected using 
structured questionnaires. The analysis involved both descriptive statistics and inferential 
statistics.The inferential results showed a positive correlation of (r=0.773, p=0.000) between 
biometric voter registration (BVR) and credibility of electoral systems. Results on electronic 
voter identification (EVID) and credibility of electoral systems showed a positive correlation of 
(r=0.784, p=0.000). Furthermore there was a significant effect between biometric voter 
registration (BVR) and credibility of electoral systems(β=.356, p=0.000), and on electronic 
voter identification (EVID) and credibility of electoral systems (β=.380, p=0.000).</p>
